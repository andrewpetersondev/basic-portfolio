          Welcome to my portfolio! I am proud to say this website is the first
          step in my web development journey. For the first time in a long time,
          I am excited. I am excited about the coding boot camp I am in. I am
          excited about the projects we will do. Mostly, I am excited about
          entering a creative community where teamwork, innovation, and
          persistence are essential for success.

          When Isaac Newton was struck by an apple he thought of gravity. When
          Richard Hendricks’ and his friends talked about “manipulating data”,
          Richard thought of middle-out compression. And as a result of a
          ridiculous conversation, Pied Piper might be able to take over world’s
          premier tech-giant, Hooli.

          If you are thinking, “Why am I still reading this nonsense? He is
          talking about a fictional show on HBO.” Here is some lorem ipsum.
          Vivamus faucibus aliquam mauris, vitae interdum felis facilisis ut.
          Pellentesque dictum urna quis dolor tristique tempor. Aliquam suscipit
          est congue erat finibus imperdiet. Morbi rutrum urna ut nibh
          malesuada, quis tristique nisi malesuada.
